* Overview
The Fuyu is a comfy TKL PCB that support multiple layouts and is compatible with a number of cases. You can pair it with something real nice, like the Geonworks F1-8K, or something a little easier on the wallet, like CustomKBD's TKRielle. It has a heap of cool features like support for multiple layouts, hella LEDs (including a programmable snowflake arrangement), and uses a RP2040 MCU.

I highly recommend checking out https://github.com/zykrah/fuyu for more info.

* Parts
- 1 x [[https://github.com/zykrah/fuyu][Fuyu PCB]]: see [[*Printing PCBs][see below on printing PCBs]]
- 87 x MX switches
- 87 x keycaps (including a 6.25U spacebar!)
- 4 x 2U, 1 x 6.25U stabs
- A compatible case, like the Geonworks F1-8K/F1-8X or CustomKBD's TKRielle.

** Printing PCBs
You can get the Fuyu PCB online from Geonworks or CustomKBD or do what I did and get it printed. I went with PCBWay and got them to assemble the PCBs for me too. I've put up a [[https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Fuyu_TKL_Keyboard_PCB_f114f3c9.html][shared project]] so all you have to do it hit /add to cart/.

* Build guide
** PCB assembly
Having the PCBs pre-assembled honestly saves a lot of time, especially if you're like me and are newer to soldering. If you're doing it the hard way, take your time soldering the components to the PCB and make sure to check out the [[https://github.com/zykrah/fuyu][Fuyu Github repo]].

If all goes well[fn::I actually messed up and forgot to include the USB-C connector ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The shared project above has the corrected BOM.], it should look a little something like this[fn::If you're nervous and want more reference images, you can see what mine looked like [[https://pcbwayfile.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mail/23/01/07/1501006057824.zip][here]].]:

** Setting up firmware
It's important to take the time now to make sure your PCB is working properly. That means plugging it into your computer and seeing if it lights up!

If you're like me and printed the PCB yourself, you'll have to flash the desired firmware onto the RP2040. If you bought it from a store, they've probably already done this for you and you can skip the rest of this section.

Luckily, the process isn't too hard. First, we need to clone and build the firmware[fn::See below if you'd rather just download a pre-built =.uf2= file]. I'm using the [[https://github.com/zykrah/vial-qmk/tree/vdev-zykrah/keyboards/zykrah/fuyu][VIAL firmware]] but you could just as easily use the [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/zykrah/slime88][firmware in QMK]] (which is VIA-compatible).

We need to clone the firmware to our machine:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/zykrah/vial-qmk/
#+end_src

Next, we need to build it. This requires [[https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools][setting up your QMK environment]], if you haven't done it before. Finally, we can run:
#+begin_src sh
make zykrah/fuyu:vial
#+end_src

If that's all too tricky, don't worry, you can download the =.uf2= file from [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/fuyu][my Github]].

Once you connect the PCB to your computer, it should automatically pop up as =RPI-RP2= and you can flash it by dragging the =.uf2= file across. If it doesn't pop up, you may need to put the RP2040 into bootloader mode by shorting the =BOOT= pins under the End key.

If you're still having issues, you've most likely flipped the orientation of an LED or a diode and caused a short-circuit. It can be tricky to work out exactly what's going wrong but there are some great Discord communities out there that may be able to help you through the troubleshooting process. Good luck!

** Installing stabilisers
Now, to the actual build.

The first step is to install your stabilisers. It's worth taking the time to lube and tune them because it's a real pain to try and adjust them once you've started soldering your switches in. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usNx1_d0HbQ][Taeha Types has a great video]] on this if you need more info.
